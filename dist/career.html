I had a fairly high GPA all four years, was a member of the National Honor Society (and president senior year), and a card-carrying member of the Interact Club. Instead of sports, I was into the a cappella choir and performing in the school musicals.</p><p class=editorial-header__excerpt>I didn't, however, have any plans whatsoever for my future. I was the funny guy, and couldn't be bothered to seriously plan out what I wanted to be when I grew up. I liked writing. And I liked playing video games. That was about all I knew.</p></article><article id=education class=editorial-header__article><h3 class=editorial-header__section-title>Education</h3><p class=editorial-header__excerpt>I thought I wanted to go to school for game development, but gave up on that pretty quickly. However, the school I was looking at for game dev also had a web development degree path, and I thought to myself, "Eh, why not?" So a year after high school, I packed up and moved to Florida to attend <em>Full Sail University</em> to get my degree in <em>Web Design and Development</em>.</p><p class=editorial-header__excerpt>As far as my research could tell, Full Sail was a dang good school, and one of the best for accelerated degree programs; 21 months after I started I had my Bachelor's. The only downside was the price tag, but I jumped in head first anyway.</p></article><article id=current-career class=editorial-header__article><h3 class=editorial-header__section-title>Current Career</h3><p class=editorial-header__excerpt>I currently work at <a href=http://perficientxd.com>Perficient XD</a>, which is the creative agency inside <a href=http://perficient.com>Perficient, Inc</a>. My official title is "Senior Technical Consultant", but more accurately I am a front-end web developer. We have designers that create fabulous website layouts, and I build them.</p><p>I landed this job a year after I graduated college, because my cousin (whom has worked here for around 15 years) took my resume and got me an interview. It's a tough world out there, and if you have an "in", exploit it. Anything that can put your resume at the top of the pile is fair game. Luckily it worked out, because I've been here for four years now and enjoy it immensely.</p><p class=editorial-header__excerpt>The "consultant" part of my job is where the fun happens, because a lot of the time it means I get to travel. Clients will have us come to their headquarters to do our work, or at the very least come in for face-to-face collaboration at key milestones. Often we'll leave be on the road for a few days at a time, and it's a great opportunity to visit places you've never been before (and not have to pay for any expenses).</p><p class=editorial-header__excerpt>Salaries are commensurate to performance. I started as a fresh college grad, and was making well-under industry standard compensation, but after a year of proving my worth I got a substantial raise. Continue that trend another three years and I'm now making almost double what my starting salary. As with most things in life, you get out what you put in.</p></article><article id=life-and-goals class=editorial-header__article><h3 class=editorial-header__section-title>Life and Goals</h3><p class=g-wide--pull-1>I've found that I get the most out of my job when I'm helping others learn something new, or helping them become more proficient at something they already know. Because of this, I've recently starting teaching a few continuing education courses at SLU's Workforce Center, and I see myself gravitating more toward an instructor / teacher role in the future. The slower pace of teaching would also lead to a smoother work / life balance, because traveling every other week was a lot more convenient before I started my family.</p><p class=g-wide--pull-1>No matter what I choose, though, there are plenty of options and roads for me to take on my career path. In the front-end technology industry, they say the only way to advance is to jump companies every three to four years. But whether I choose to stay at Perficient or elsewise, the options are there for me.</p></article></div></div></section></main><footer id=gc-footer><div class=container><p><a href=#main>Back to top</a></p></div></footer></div><script src=https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js></script><script src=scripts/main.min.js></script></body></html>
